# Car Price Prediction ðŸš— ðŸ“ˆ

I have built a Machine Learning model to predict the price of a car based on several features like the selling price, fuel and transmission type to name a few.

One Hot Encoding is applied to convert the categorical data into numerical data so that an ML model can be easily built on top of it.

One of the biggest problems of decision trees, which is one of the traditional methods, is overfitting. Random Forest model has been developed to overcome this problem.
Hence I have used Random Forest to predict the car price after tunning the hyperparameters using Grid Search.
